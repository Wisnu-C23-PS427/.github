## Description About Our Project
### Machine Learning
In this project, we create machine learning that is used to provide itinerary planning and find local tour guides based on recommendation systems and then we also provide some decisions for the results by showing the accuracy of the predictions.

### Mobile Development 
We created the UI and overall application flow, designing the API response with the CC team to ensure we can parallel work while waiting for the deployed API. We utilize MVVM architecture patterns across the app with Dagger/Hilt to handle dependencies.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing: We implemented API endpoints for the MD team in a Flask server and integrated it with a machine learning model made by the ML team. Then, we deployed the server and the database which uses MySQL to Google Cloud.
